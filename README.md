# fizika

Small javascript (and html) project aimes solving physics school tasks, automatically.
Inputs are:
- physics terms (i.e. F - force), and it's units (i.e. N)
- physics equations (i.e. F=m*a)
- given data for the task (i.e. m=1 kg, a=4 m/s2)

Outputs:
- derived equations (i.e. m=F/a)
- calculated values (i.e. F = 4 N)
- based on the calculated values, calculating next available values based on the set of equations available.
